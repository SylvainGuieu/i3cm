# I3CM 

High level arcithecture of the I3CM software.  

Given the fact that the software will be run on a Beagle the soft is separated so that a server can be ran on the beeagle or whatever PC talking to devices and a client can be ran on a distant PC. 

The whole system desciption is done with configuration files in yaml langage. These configuration are red and wrote inside a simple, flat, database. The database is only key/values pairs that can be mirrored by any client. The idea is that the whole system configuration and state is inside the database.
